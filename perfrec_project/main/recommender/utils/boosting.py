"""
Scoring utilities for reranking perfume recommendations using soft contextual filtering.

This module provides functions that adjust base recommendation scores by applying
lightweight user preference signals, such as preferred seasons, occasions, or types,
based on perfume metadata (chart distributions). These adjustments allow
recommendations to reflect user context while keeping collaborative information.

Currently implemented:
    - soft_boost: Boosts scores based on overlap between perfume chart categories and user-selected filters.
